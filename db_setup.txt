1. Open cmd and navigate the directory to the bin folder inside your mongodb installation folder.
2. Start mongo shell by typing 'mongo' in the cmd.(If you are having trouble starting the mongo shell go to the youtube link which I have
	shared in the bottom of the readme file.)
3. Now run the following commands one by one in mongo shell.

use mailer;

db.createCollection('users');

db.createCollection('messages');

4. Now your db has been setup.
